# Welcome to SAIT's Creative Writing Club!

Our group is just beginning, and this website and is under construction. We have a lot of things planned, so please bare with us!


## Rules

* **Be caring.** A safe environment is our first priority. While all writers and all writing forms are welcomed, if a work is offensive, please inform the club before presenting and sharing.

* **Be considerate.** Have a mutual respect for all writers and their works, be mindful of your behavior.

* **Be collaborative.** While group discussion and online publication is not mandatory, each club member has the ability and is encouraged to share and connect.

* **Be determined!** Writing can be difficult at times, so do it every day. Seek and share motivation and discipline from other club members.


## Where and When?

Currently, we meet every Wednesday from 4:30pm to 6:30pm in Room MB216 in the Stan Grad Centre.  


## Club Administrators
