# SAITwrite: The official website of SAIT's Creative Writing Club!


## Code of Conduct

**Be caring.** A safe environment is our first priority. While all writers and all writing forms are welcomed, if a work is offensive, please inform the club before presenting and sharing.
**Be considerate.** Have a mutual respect for all writers and their works, be mindful of your behavior.
**Be collaborative.** While group discussion and online publication is not mandatory, each club member has the ability and is encouraged to share and connect.
**Be determined!** Writing can be difficult at times, so do it every day. Seek and share motivation and discipline from other club members.
